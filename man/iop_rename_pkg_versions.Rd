\title{Rename columns in a data frame to more readable versions}
\usage{
iop_rename_pkg_versions(d)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A data frame representing package version information with columns
possibly named "requirement", "is_installed", "installed_version", and
"all_passed". If `NULL` is passed, the function returns `NULL` without
performing any operations.}
}
\value{
A data frame with renamed columns, where "requirement" is renamed to
"Requirement", "is_installed" is renamed to "Installed", "installed_version"
is renamed to "Version", and "all_passed" is renamed to "Passed". If `dat`
is `NULL`, the function returns `NULL`.
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame that contains package version information
and renames specific columns to more readable versions. It is typically used
to improve the readability of package dependency report outputs. If `dat` is
`NULL`, the function immediately returns `NULL`.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
example_df <- data.frame(
  requirement = c("pkgA > 1.0.0", "pkgB > 2.0.0"),
  is_installed = c(TRUE, FALSE),
  installed_version = c("1.2.0", NA),
  all_passed = c(TRUE, NA)
)

renamed_df <- iop_rename_pkg_versions(example_df)
}
# The renamed_df should have columns named "Requirement", "Installed",
# "Version", and "Passed", corresponding to the previous names.
