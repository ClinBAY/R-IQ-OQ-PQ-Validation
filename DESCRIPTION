Description: Facilitates the creation of automated Installation Qualification (IQ),
    Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ) reports for R
    environments, particularly in regulated industries. The package verifies package
    installations and test results against predefined specifications, generating
    comprehensive PDF or HTML reports to support software validation processes. It is
    useful for ensuring reproducibility and regulatory compliance across multiple R
    installations.
