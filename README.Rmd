# iopqualr: Automated IQ/OQ/PQ Report Generation for R in Regulated Environments

An open-source R program for creating automated Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), and Performance Qualification (PQ) reports for R environments.

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Introduction

When **using R in a regulated and controlled environment** (like in the pharmaceutical research industry), you must ensure and prove that the output of your R programs are **accurate** and **reproducible**.

The purpose of this package is to **generate automatic** installation, operational and performance qualification (IQ/OQ/PQ) **assessment report in PDF** or HTML format for an R installation. Such IQ/OQ/PQ report can be used to comply with validation and quality assurance requirements when using R in a regulated environment.

The Program uses as **input** a **YAML** file defining a list of packages versions and tests to execute, and verifies that these packages are installed with the expected version and that test run successfully.

As a result, this R package produces a **PDF or HTML report** summarizing all the IQ/OQ/PQ tests executed and presents a qualification outcome (PASSED or FAILED). The report also details the operating environment and installation parameters of the R installation.

This R package can be used on any R environment to ensure that it matches the expected configuration and works as expected. It is particularly **useful** in companies having R installed on **several user environments** and aiming to ensure that they are all **identical and produce the same results**.

For more information about validation and qualification of R in regulated environments, we recommend following the [R Validation Hub](https://www.pharmar.org/overview/).

If you need support to perform your own validation or qualification of R, feel free to [contact us](https://www.clinbay.com/contact-us) at ClinBAY, we’ll be happy to support you.

## How it works

As you can see on the below diagram, the process is simple:

 1. **Writing** some automated **tests** to be executed for each package, in order to ensure that they work as expected and produce correct and reproducible results

 2. **Creating** an **input YAML file** listing the list of required packages and their version, along with the path of the directory that contains the tests to execute

 3. **Executing** the **function iop_create_report** to produce the output PDF report, which lists all the tests executed and presents the Qualification outcome

## Accessing the package

### Installing the R package

#### Installation from CRAN

You can install the released version of {}s
iopqualr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("iopqualr", dependencies = TRUE)
```
#### Installation from GitHub

To install the package from a GitHub repository:

``` r
#install devtools package
install.packages("devtools")
# In the below, github_repo_url is the part of path to the github repository
# containing the code with title extracted.
# Example: "ClinBAY/R-IQ-OQ-PQ-Validation"
devtools::install_github("<github_repo_url>", dependencies = TRUE)
```
#### Installation from a local folder or .zip file

This package can also be installed from a local compressed folder.
Rtools should be installed first from [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and added to Environment Variables(installation instructions can be found on the Rtools page link). Rtools is used on Windows to build R base and R packages that contain compiled code, and is required to install an R package from source.

Install the package and other required packages by running:

``` r
#installing .zip file
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install("C:/path_to_zip/name_of_zip.zip", dependencies = TRUE)

```

Alternatively, if the folder is not compressed, the following can be used to install the package:

``` r
#install devtools package
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install("C:/path_to_folder/", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Loading the package in R

To use the package, it has to be loaded into the R environment.

```
library(iopqualr)
```

### System Requirements

To render the PDF file from an RMarkdown template, both LaTeX and Pandoc are required

+ The LaTeX requirement can be met by installing tinytex [LaTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) .
+ If RStudio is used then Pandoc is included, otherwise [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) may have to be installed on your system.

## Usage

### Standard Operating Process

 1. The Program is installed
 2. The user creates a specification file in a structured input format such as JSON or YAML (the "Spec")
    + Spec includes requirements on operating system, R installation, R packages (along with their acceptable version number or range).
    + Spec details every R package which must be present and which tests to run on each package.
 3. User runs the Program
    + Provide the input directory containing all the files needed for report generation. The output report and test results will also be saved in this directory.
    + Specify the path to the folder where test results will be saved.
    + Provide the location and file name of the specifications file as parameters.
 4. Program runs using Spec as input
 5. Program creates PDF R IQ-OQ-PQ report (the "Output") and writes to output location.

### Inputs

The inputs to the qualification assessments is a YAML specification file which is read by the package into a an R list. The YAML file can be generated using the built-in assistant:

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
iop_input_helper()
```

The input file contains the following mandatory elements:

 1. **report_author**: author as should appear on front of the report
 2. **packages**: list of required packages and package versions of the same format as the R package DESCRIPTION file
 3. **custom_tests_path**: path to custom test files
 4. **custom_operational_tests**: list of packages for which custom operational tests area available and should be run
 5. **custom_performance_tests**: list of packages for which custom performance tests area available and should be run

View a sample YAML containing tests specifications: [sample_input.yaml](./inst/extdata/sample_input.yaml)


### Tests

If any packages are listed in the inputs for custom performance or operational tests then the `custom_tests_path` directory must contain tests to run for that package using the `testthat` framework in the location `custom_tests_path\pkg_name\{operational, performance}`.

#### Instructions

##### Custom Performance and Operational Tests

###### 1. Create a Main Tests Directory

Create a main folder where you want to organize all the test folders. For example:

- On your Desktop, right-click and select `New Folder`.
- Name this folder `custom_tests_path`.

###### 2. Create Subdirectories for Each Package

Inside the `custom_tests_path` directory, create subdirectories for each package that will contain the performance and operational tests. For instance, if you are testing the `mvtnorm` package:

- Open the `custom_tests_path` folder.
- Create a new folder named `mvtnorm`.
- Inside the `mvtnorm` folder, create two subfolders: `performance` and `operational`.

The directory structure should look something like this:

    custom_tests_path
    └── mvtnorm
        ├── performance
        │   └── (performance test files here)
        └── operational
            └── (operational test files here)
            
Repeat this process for each package you are testing (e.g., `DoseFinding`, `MCPMod`, `ggplot2`). 

###### 3. Writing Custom Tests

Once the directory structure is set, you can write custom performance and operational tests for each package.

###### Performance Test Example

In `custom_tests_path/pkg_name/performance`, create `.R` files with the necessary test scripts. For instance, to create a performance test for the `mvtnorm` package:

```r
test_that("pmvnorm returns length 1", {
  expect_less_than(
    system.time(replicate(10^4, mvtnorm::qmvt(sigma=1, p=0.01)$quantile))[[3]],
    0.5
  )
})
```

###### Operational Test Example

In `custom_tests_path/pkg_name/operational`, create `.R` files with the necessary test scripts. For example, to create operational tests for the `mvtnorm` package:

```r
test_that("Miwa function is exported", {
  expect_equal(class(mvtnorm::Miwa), "function")
})

test_that("pmvnorm returns length 1", {
  expect_equal(length(mvtnorm::pmvnorm(sigma=1)), 1L)
})
```

###### 4. Verify Directory Structure

Ensure your `custom_tests_path` folder looks something like this, with subdirectories for performance and operational tests for each package:

    custom_tests_path
    ├── DoseFinding
    │   ├── performance
    │   │   └── (performance test files here)
    │   └── operational
    │       └── (operational test files here)
    ├── mvtnorm
    │   ├── performance
    │   │   └── (performance test files here)
    │   └── operational
    │       └── (operational test files here)
    ├── MCPMod
    │   ├── performance
    │   │   └── (performance test files here)
    │   └── operational
    │       └── (operational test files here)
    └── ggplot2
        ├── performance
        │   └── (performance test files here)
        └── operational
            └── (operational test files here)

### Pre-Requisites to Running (IMPORTANT)

 > if any of these pre-requisites are not met, then the report will not be produced

 1. **settings_directory**: The directory where the settings file (a `*.yaml` file) is stored.

 2. **settings_file**: An input file, such as the `sample_input.yaml` provided within the package, must be found under the `settings_directory` folder. The content of a valid `settings_file` is presented below:

    <details>
    <summary style="font-size: 14px;">Click to show <code>`sample_input.yaml`</code></summary>
    <p>

      ```yaml
          ---
          description: Sample IOP-Qualification Input File
          report_author: Company Name
          r_version: 3.3.4
          packages:
            - MCPMod (== 1.0-10)
            - mvtnorm (== 1.0-6)
            - ggplot2 (== 3.3.5)
            - DoseFinding (== 1.1-1)
            - idontexist
            - idontexist (== 1.0.0)
            - dplyr (== 1.0.0)
            - dplyr
          custom_tests_path: /home/your-user/iopqualr/tests
          custom_performance_tests:
            - mvtnorm
          custom_operational_tests:
            - mvtnorm
          test_types:
            - examples
            - vignettes
            - tests
          ...

      ```

    </p>
    </details>
 The YAML file can be generated using the built-in assistant `iop_input_helper()`.

 3. **input_directory**: The directory where the `report.Rmd` file is stored (a template for the iop_create_report function). The template file **must** be named exactly as described.

 4. **custom_tests_path**: All custom tests must be found in this directory, as defined in `settings_file`.

 NOTE: For Windows binary installations of R 3.4.3. The file `demos.Rout` must be found in the `C:\iopqualr` directory (or whichever directory is specified as the `run_directory` in when the iop_create_report command is run).

### Installation and Usage Example

Below follow complete installation and usage examples, (based on a Windows 10 Professional 64-bit system).
To make these examples relevant to a specific use case, details regarding which system resources to use (drive), directories and specific packages to install (and/or compile) would neeed to be changed by the user.

#### 1. Installation example

##### Using a Windows batch file

This <a href="./windows-scripts/install.bat" target="_blank">install.bat</a> installation example is structured as a batch file to be run on windows, to install R, some example packages, iopqualr, TinyTex, Pandoc on a test environment:

It is relatively complete in that it includes R packages which need compilation. If this is not the case, then the installation of RTools would not be necessary.

The commands contained in this example could be run either in scripts (batch files) or individually. If the commands are run individually the the variables represented by `%..%` notation would have to be made explicit (i.e. run `C:\iopqualr\R-3.4.3-win.exe` instead of `%run-directory%\R-3.4.3-win.exe`).

##### Using R commands

Instead of using the above batch file, you can also perform the below operational steps manually to install the example packages to test:

 1. Install this package (iopqualr) and its required components (TinyTex to create PDF and Pandoc for Markdown if RStudio is not installed) (see above section System Requirements for details)

 2. Install the below packages for which tests will be executed:

 ```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools', type='win.binary')
remotes::install_version('mvtnorm', version='1.0-6', type='source', dependencies= TRUE)
remotes::install_version('DoseFinding', version='0.9-15', type='source', dependencies= TRUE, upgrade='never')
remotes::install_version('ggplot2', version='2.2.1', type='source', dependencies= TRUE, upgrade='never')
install.packages('MCPMod', type='win.binary', dependencies= TRUE)
install.packages('evaluate', type='win.binary', dependencies= TRUE)
 ```

#### 2. Configuration example

Once the example packages to test have been installed (see above section), you can create a local directory where to store the YAML input file, the tests to execute, the output test results and the PDF report:

 1. Create a local directory where to store the test files (e.g. `C:\iopqualr`)

 2. Copy to the local directory the GitHub <a href="./tests/" target="_blank">tests directory</a> with the example tests to execute to perform the qualification of the example packages installed

 3. Create a `settings` folder in the local directory and save <a href="/inputs/sample_input.yaml" target="_blank"> this example YAML file</a>.

 4. Update the YAML file to set the `custom_tests_path` option to the `<local directory>\tests` path


#### 3. Run example

For the configuration examples defined in the previous section, you would run the below R code to produce the R report:

 ```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(iopqualr)
iop_create_report(
    input_directory = "C:/iopqualr/input/",
    settings_directory = "C:/iopqualr/settings",
    test_outputs_directory = "C:/iopqualr/input/test-outputs",
    settings_file = "sample_input.yaml",
    html_report = TRUE
)
 ```

##### Parameters of `iop_create_report`

As can be seen from the above example, the function `iop_create_report` is used to run the qualification processes and create the associated report.

`iop_create_report` has the following parameters, for which appropriate arguments must be supplied:
+ `settings_file`: name of the settings file (*.yaml) used to generate the report. For example "qualification_settings.yaml"
+ `settings_directory`: full path to the directory where the settings file is stored. For example "C:/qualification_project"
+ `input_directory`: full path to the directory where Rmd file is stored. For example "C:/qualification_project/inputs"
+ `tests_output_directory`: full path to the directory where test outputs shuold be stored. For example "C:/qualifiction_projcet/outputs"
#' `html_report` logical flag to enable html report generation. Either `TRUE` (to get an HTML report):w
or `FALSE`.

For further details on the settings and inputs see `Pre-Requisites to Running (IMPORTANT)` above.

### Investigating FALSE Values in Tests using iopqualr Package

To investigate possible FALSE values for tests using the `iopqualr` package, start by utilizing several features and functions provided in the package. The investigation can be systematized into two main steps: examining the output files and re-running the failing tests individually.

#### Examining Output Files

The `iop_create_report` function generates a detailed PDF or HTML report summarizing the results of the package tests, including the ones that failed. By setting proper directories and input files, you can generate this report:

```R
library(iopqualr)

iop_create_report(
   input_directory = "path/to/input/",
   settings_directory = "path/to/settings",
   test_outputs_directory = "path/to/test-outputs",
   settings_file = "settings_file_name.yaml",
   html_report = TRUE
)
```

In this report, each test is documented with its outcome (PASSED or FAILED), and for failures, reasons or error messages associated with the failure are provided, which can act as a primary source of insight.

You can then check the provided `test_outputs_directory` for files containing "fail" (e.g., `base-Ex.Rout.fail`) at the end and then examine them thoughtfully as those files contain full logs of running separate tests and their results.

#### Running Failing Tests Individually

Use functions such as `iop_gen_test_results`, `iop_summarise_results`, and `iop_run_custom_tests` to run and summarize specific test results:

```R
# Load settings from input file
settings <- iop_load_input_file("path/to/settings/settings_file_name.yaml")

# Generate all test results
results <- iop_gen_test_results(settings)

# Summarize the results
summary <- iop_summarise_results(results)
print(summary)
```

If a specific test has failed, use the package-specific functions to re-run the tests in isolation to get more detailed diagnostic information. For example:

```R
# Run custom operational tests for a specific package (e.g., mvtnorm)
oper_results <- iop_run_custom_tests(
   packages = c("mvtnorm"),
   type = "operational",
   tests_path = settings[["custom_tests_path"]]
)
print(oper_results)
```

### User Requirements

If R and its packages were installed in a system related directory, the `iop_create_report()` function will only work accordingly if the user run R or RStudio as an administrator or root user.
+ On Windows, to run R or Rstudio as an administrator, when starting the program from the Start Menu, right click the program and select the Run as administrator option.

Alternatively, administrator privileges are not required if R and RStudio were installed in a user owned directory.

### TexLive updates

When running examples above with setting output report format to PDF, you may run into missing package errors, such as `! LaTeX Error: File 'xyz.sty' not found.` This commonly occurs if your LaTeX distribution does not have all required packages installed out-of-the-box. This section provides installation suggestions for extra packages on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Installation Instructions

##### macOS

1. **Using MacTeX:**
   - Ensure you have MacTeX installed. If not, download and install it from [tug.org](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).
   - After installation, use the TeX Live Manager (tlmgr) to manage and install additional packages. Keeping your MacTeX installation up-to-date ensures you have the latest packages.
   - Open Terminal and run:
     ```sh
     sudo tlmgr update --self --all
     sudo tlmgr install <package-name>
     ```

##### Windows

1. **Using MiKTeX:**
   - Download and install MiKTeX from [miktex.org](https://miktex.org/).
   - Open MiKTeX Console (search for it in the Start menu).
   - In the "Packages" tab, you can search for and install additional packages.
   - Keep your MiKTeX installation up-to-date to ensure you have the latest packages. Enable the "Install missing packages on-the-fly" option for automatic installation when required.

2. **Using TeX Live:**
   - If you prefer TeX Live, download and install it from [tug.org/texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).
   - Use the TeX Live Manager (tlmgr) to manage packages. Open Command Prompt as an administrator and run:
     ```sh
     tlmgr update --self --all
     tlmgr install <package-name>
     ```

##### Linux (Ubuntu)

1. **Using TeX Live:**
   - Install TeX Live and the recommended extras by running:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
     sudo apt-get install texlive-full  # This installs the complete TeX Live distribution
     ```
   - Keep your TeX Live installation up-to-date:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get upgrade texlive-latex-extra
     sudo apt-get upgrade texlive-full
     ```

#### General Recommendations

- Regardless of the operating system, ensure your LaTeX distribution is up-to-date. This minimizes the chance of encountering missing packages.
- Use a package manager provided by your LaTeX distribution (e.g., `tlmgr` for TeX Live, MiKTeX Console for MiKTeX) to install and update packages.
- Enabling automatic package installation features can simplify the process of managing dependencies.

### Core System Tests

Core system tests are often unavailable in many R installations, including minimal installations, precompiled binaries, and custom setups. Our package accounts for this by including these tests and marking their results as "N/A" if the core tests are not provided.

The unavailability of core system tests can be due to several reasons:

- **Precompiled Binaries**: To save on download size and installation time, precompiled binary installations may exclude core tests.
- **Custom Installation Options**: Custom installations might disable these tests based on specific configurations.
- **Older Versions of R**: Older R versions may have different configurations that do not include core tests.
- **Minimal Installations**: Specific installations tailored for minimalistic setups may purposely exclude these tests.
- **User/Admin Choices**: Decisions made during the installation process might lead to exclusion of the core tests.
---

### Output

The output of the report generation contains:

1. details of all tests run
2. result of every test run, including reason-indicator in case of failure
3. overall result of tests run, including summary of test results
4. context description for each test so that
    * the results and significance can be interpreted
    * the report can be read by humans possessing required domain expertise
5. a description of the tested environment, including the list of packages in the environment and their versions

## Unit Test Descriptions

Unit tests, stored in 'testthat' directory, help to ensure that individual components function correctly, prevent future regressions, and facilitate easier maintenance and refactoring. Below are the descriptions of  unit test files created for iopqualr package, detailing their purposes.

### test_folder_validation.R

This file contains unit tests to validate the function `iop_check_output_dir()`. The primary purpose is to ensure correct specification and distinction among different directories ('input', 'settings', and 'output') used in a data input and processing pipeline.

#### Tests:
1. **Output directory is distinct**
2. **Output directory same as input directory**
3. **Output directory (with slash) same as input directory**
4. **Output directory same as settings directory**
5. **Output directory (with slash) same as settings directory**
6. **Output directory is an empty string**
7. **Input or settings directory is an empty string**

### test_help_functions.R

This file tests the `iop_get_help_desc()` function to ensure that it retrieves help descriptions accurately across a variety of conditions and inputs.

#### Tests:
1. **Returns help description for valid objects**
2. **Works with default argument**
3. **Collapses and trims whitespace**
4. **Throws an error for non-existing objects**

### test_input_management.R

This file validates the `iop_load_input_file()` function, which is responsible for loading input files (such as YAML files) into an R data structure, typically a list.

#### Tests:
1. **Loads a sample YAML file**
2. **Returns a list**

### test_report_generation.R

This file includes unit tests to ensure the proper functioning of functions involved in generating and formatting reports, specifically using the `xtable` package for HTML or LaTeX outputs.

#### Tests:

1. **iop_print_xtable**:
   - **Returns NULL for NULL input**
   - **Works with HTML output**
   - **Works with LaTeX output**

2. **iop_color_logical**:
   - **Colors logical values correctly**
   - **Handles NULL input correctly**

3. **iop_custom_sanitize**:
   - **Leaves custom colored FALSE unchanged**
   - **Sanitizes input without custom FALSE**

4. **iop_custom_add_row**:
   - **Returns the correct list**
